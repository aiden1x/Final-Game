# Final-Game
The full completion of my game was supposed to be a enemy atacking the 2d model and the 2d model had to kill the enemy. The enemy was supposed to try and kill the 2d model.
I accomplished the movement and all the animations and i've learned how to make 2d games and animations.
All that is left is too finish the script for attacking the 2d model and add box colliders to the walls. Also importing the enemy spawners.
